## Overview

GeniusOS AI Agents Platform provides a subscription-based service for accessing AI agents. Users can subscribe to different plans and purchase additional tokens for extended usage.

## Architecture

The application uses a modern serverless architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: React application with Vite
- **External API**: All primary data operations use `https://db.api.geniusos.co`
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth for SSO users only
- **Payments**: Stripe integration via Supabase Edge Functions only

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Primary Data Source**: 
   - All application data (plans, subscriptions, tokens, etc.) is served from the external API at `https://db.api.geniusos.co`
   - The Railway PostgreSQL database stores plans and subscription data, accessed via the external API

2. **Supabase Usage (LIMITED SCOPE)**:
   - Supabase is used ONLY for:
     - User authentication (SSO)
     - Stripe payment processing via Edge Functions
   - No application data is stored in or retrieved from Supabase

> **IMPORTANT**: This application should NEVER implement any API services locally. All data operations (plans, subscriptions, tokens, etc.) MUST be accessed through the external API service at `https://db.api.geniusos.co`. This is a critical architectural requirement.

> **⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING ⚠️**: NEVER modify the code to use local API endpoints (like http://127.0.0.1:XXXX) in production or development code. Always use the external API endpoint `https://db.api.geniusos.co` through the apiUrl() helper function. Local endpoints should only be used for testing in isolated environments and should never be committed to the codebase. This is a strict architectural requirement to maintain data integrity and security.

## Features

- User authentication and management via Supabase
- Subscription plans with different tiers
- Token-based usage system
- Secure payment processing with Stripe
- Dashboard for managing subscriptions and tokens
- RESTful API for accessing subscription plans and managing user subscriptions

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **External API**: `https://db.api.geniusos.co` for all data operations
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **UI Components**: Custom components with FaRobot icons from react-icons/fa6
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom color scheme (#1A1E23 for content panels, #1F242B for sidebar)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe (via external API)
- **Deployment**: Railway

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-agents-geniusos-co.git
   cd ai-agents-geniusos-co
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (see Configuration section)

4. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Start the frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Always run the development server on port 5173. This port is specifically configured for OAuth redirects and other services. If you encounter the error "Port 5173 is already in use", make sure to kill any existing processes using that port before starting the server:
> ```bash
> npx kill-port 5173
> npm run dev
> ```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Supabase Configuration (ONLY for authentication and Stripe payments)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Stripe Configuration
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key

# Railway PostgreSQL (accessed via https://db.api.geniusos.co, not directly)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/railway
```

### Railway PostgreSQL Configuration

1. Create a Railway PostgreSQL database at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Get your connection string from the Railway dashboard
3. Add it to your `.env` file as `DATABASE_URL`
4. Run the setup script to initialize your environment:

### Supabase Configuration

Supabase is used ONLY for:
1. User authentication (SSO)
2. Stripe payment processing via Edge Functions

To configure Supabase:

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Enable email authentication in the Auth settings
3. Get your Supabase URL and anon key from the project settings
4. Add them to your `.env` file

### OAuth Configuration

The application uses OAuth providers (Google, Slack) for authentication. To configure OAuth:

#### Google OAuth Setup

1. Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
3. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application)
4. Add authorized JavaScript origins:
   - Development: `http://localhost:5173` (fixed port in vite.config.js)
   - Production: `https://agentops.geniusos.co`
   - Supabase URL: `https://qdrtpsuqffsdocjrifwm.supabase.co`
5. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - Development: `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`
   - Production: `https://agentops.geniusos.co/auth/callback`
   - Supabase callback: `https://qdrtpsuqffsdocjrifwm.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

#### Slack OAuth Setup

1. Create a Slack app at [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Under "OAuth & Permissions", add redirect URLs:
   - Development: `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`
   - Production: `https://agentops.geniusos.co/auth/callback`
   - Supabase callback: `https://qdrtpsuqffsdocjrifwm.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
3. Add the necessary scopes (typically `identity.basic`, `identity.email`)

#### Supabase OAuth Configuration

1. In the Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > Providers
2. Enable and configure Google and Slack providers with the client IDs and secrets
3. Ensure the redirect URL in Supabase matches what you've configured in the OAuth providers

### Supabase Edge Functions

The application uses Supabase Edge Functions specifically for Stripe integration:

- `stripe-customers`: Handles customer creation and retrieval
- `stripe-payment-methods`: Handles payment method operations
- `stripe-subscriptions`: Handles subscription operations

These functions are only called during user authentication and payment processing flows. For more details, see the [SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTIONS.md](./SUPABASE_EDGE_FUNCTIONS.md) document.

### Stripe Integration

#### Setting Up Stripe

1. Create a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Get your API keys from the Stripe Dashboard (Developers > API keys)
3. Add them to your `.env` file:
   - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Your publishable key (starts with `pk_`)

#### Creating Products and Prices

1. Go to Products in your Stripe Dashboard
2. Create products for your subscription plans and token packages
3. For each product, create a price:
   - For subscription plans: Set as recurring
   - For token packages: Set as one-time

#### Setting Up Webhooks

1. Go to Developers > Webhooks in your Stripe Dashboard
2. Add an endpoint with your API URL: `https://your-api-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Select events to listen for (at minimum: payment_intent.succeeded, customer.subscription.created/updated/deleted)
4. Copy the signing secret to your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

#### Local Webhook Testing

For local development, use the Stripe CLI:

1. Install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)
2. Login to your Stripe account:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```
3. Forward webhook events to your local server:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3001/api/stripe/webhook
   ```
4. Use the provided webhook signing secret for local testing

## Development

### API Endpoints

All primary application data is accessed through the external API at `https://db.api.geniusos.co`:

- `GET /api/plans` - Get all active subscription plans
- `GET /api/plans/{id}` - Get a specific plan by ID

### Supabase Edge Functions

The Supabase Edge Functions handle ONLY:
- User authentication via Supabase
- Stripe payment processing

To deploy the Edge Functions:

1. Install the Supabase CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install supabase/tap/supabase
   ```

2. Link your Supabase project:
   ```bash
   supabase login
   supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
   ```

3. Deploy the Edge Functions:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy --no-verify-jwt
   ```

For local development, you can run the Edge Functions locally:

```bash
supabase functions serve --env-file ./supabase/.env
```
